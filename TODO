- [ ] Optimize renderer:

    Current implementation is looping over each pixel each frame. Moreover, 
    it's looping for each render command (screen clear, render rect and etc.)
    for each pixel. 
    								n^2 * m
    Where is `n` - number of pixels, and `m` - number of render commands on 
    frame. Try to reduce algorithm to only `m`. Loop over pixel when it's 
    neccecery.

- [ ] Implement line rendering algorithm:

- [ ] Circles ???

- [ ] Build as static library.
